## Session: 2026-01-27 (Feature #55 - Parallel Agent)

### Feature #55 Completed: Reposition View on Instagram Link in Lightbox

**Status:** ✅ PASSING

**Category:** Lightbox

**Description:** The "View on Instagram" link in the lightbox was at the bottom of the details panel, requiring scrolling with long captions. Moved it to be directly below the media (image/video) so it's always visible.

**Implementation Details:**

1. **JavaScript Changes (assets/js/frontend.js)**:
   - Modified `createPopup()` method (lines 858-876)
   - Added new wrapper div: `bwg-igf-popup-media-wrapper`
   - Moved "View on Instagram" link from `.bwg-igf-popup-details` to wrapper
   - New structure:
     ```
     bwg-igf-popup-content
       bwg-igf-popup-media-wrapper (NEW)
         bwg-igf-popup-media-container (image/video)
         bwg-igf-popup-link (Instagram link)
       bwg-igf-popup-details
         bwg-igf-popup-caption
         bwg-igf-popup-stats
     ```

2. **CSS Changes (assets/css/frontend.css)**:
   - Added `.bwg-igf-popup-media-wrapper` styles (line 422)
     - Flexbox column layout with 15px gap
     - Centers link below media
   - Removed duplicate link styles from mobile media query (line 1292)

3. **Version Bump**:
   - Updated to 1.3.15 in bwg-instagram-feed.php
   - Updated readme.txt stable tag to 1.3.15

**Verification Steps:**

1. ✅ **Identified current placement**: Link was inside `.bwg-igf-popup-details` below caption and stats
2. ✅ **Moved link below media**: Now in `.bwg-igf-popup-media-wrapper` directly after image/video
3. ✅ **Link remains accessible**: Proper styling with Instagram gradient, hover effects, focus states
4. ✅ **Tested with multiple posts**:
   - Navigated through feed at http://localhost:8088/aspect-ratio-grid-test/
   - Clicked post to open lightbox
   - Link visible immediately without scrolling
   - Used Next button to navigate to post 2
   - Link remained in correct position

**User Experience Improvements:**
- Link always visible without scrolling through caption
- Logically positioned near the media it links to
- Details panel can focus on caption and stats
- Consistent behavior regardless of caption length
- Works with both image and video posts

**Screenshots:**
- `.playwright-mcp/feature55-feed-page.png` - Grid feed before opening lightbox
- `.playwright-mcp/feature55-lightbox-opened.png` - Lightbox with link below image (Post 1)
- `.playwright-mcp/feature55-next-post.png` - Navigation to Post 2, link still visible

**No console errors detected.**
