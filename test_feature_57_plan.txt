Feature 57: Smooth Slider Transitions - Test Plan

Test Steps:
1. Navigate to feed editor for Feed ID 12 (slider)
2. Verify new "Slide Transition Duration (ms)" field exists in Layout tab
3. Check default value (600ms)
4. Test with 300ms (faster transition)
5. Test with 1000ms (slower, smoother transition)
6. Verify infinite loop still works correctly
7. Verify autoplay timing is unaffected (only animation speed changes)

Expected Results:
- New field appears after "Autoplay Speed (ms)" field
- Field has min=200, max=2000, step=100
- Default is 600ms
- Transitions are smooth at all tested values
- Faster values (300ms) make slides snap quickly
- Slower values (1000ms) make slides glide smoothly
