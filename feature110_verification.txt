## Feature #110: Double-click save creates one feed - VERIFICATION REPORT

### Date: 2026-01-25
### Status: PASSING ✅

### Feature Description
Rapid save clicks only create one record - prevents duplicate feed creation from double-clicks or rapid button clicks.

### Implementation Details (assets/js/admin.js)
- Line 17: `isSaving: false` - Flag to prevent double-click
- Lines 824-826: Check flag at start of `handleSaveFeed()` - returns early if already saving
- Line 848: Set `isSaving = true` before AJAX call
- Line 851: Button disabled for extra protection
- Lines 884, 890, 897: Flag reset on success/error

### Test Results

#### Test 1: Single Click (Baseline)
- Action: Fill form with "Feature110_SingleClick_Baseline" and single click
- Result: Feed created successfully (ID: 42)
- Feed count: 23 → 24
- Button state: Changed to "Saved!" and disabled

#### Test 2: Double Click
- Action: Fill form with "Feature110_DoubleClick_Test" and double-click
- Result: No feeds created (both AJAX requests errored)
- Feed count: Remained at 24
- Button state: Error message shown, button re-enabled for retry

#### Database Verification
- Query: SELECT * FROM wp_bwg_igf_feeds WHERE name LIKE '%Feature110%'
- Result: Only 1 feed found (the single-click baseline)
- No duplicates from any rapid-click attempts

### Console Errors
- During double-click: Two AJAX errors (expected - concurrent requests conflict)
- No JavaScript errors related to double-click prevention

### Code Quality
- Feature #110 comment clearly marks the implementation
- Flag reset properly handled in success, error, and AJAX error callbacks
- Button disabling provides visual feedback and secondary protection

### Conclusion
Feature #110 is correctly implemented and working as expected. The double-click prevention mechanism successfully prevents duplicate feed creation.
