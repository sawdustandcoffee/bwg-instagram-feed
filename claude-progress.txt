2. Created test feed (ID=1) named "TEST_SHORTCODE_FEED_43" in database
3. Created test page "Test Shortcode Page Feature 43" with shortcode
4. Verified all HTML structure renders correctly

### Code Flow Verified
1. `bwg-instagram-feed.php` - Shortcode registration via `add_shortcode('bwg_igf', ...)`
2. `render_shortcode()` method - Processes attributes, includes template
3. `templates/frontend/feed.php` - Queries database for feed by ID, renders HTML

### Verification Details
- Feed container renders with correct classes: `bwg-igf-feed bwg-igf-grid bwg-igf-grid-3`
- Correct data attribute: `data-feed-id="1"`
- CSS variables applied: `--bwg-igf-gap: 10px; --bwg-igf-border-radius: 0px`

- "Follow on Instagram" button renders correctly
- No JavaScript console errors

### Test Environment

- Test page URL: http://localhost:8082/test-shortcode-page-feature-43/
- WordPress credentials: wptest / wptest123

### Notes
- Shortcode supports both `id` and `feed` (slug) attributes

- Template includes loading state, grid/slider layouts, overlay effects
- Follow button pulls username from feed's instagram_usernames field
