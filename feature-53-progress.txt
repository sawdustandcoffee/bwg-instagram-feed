## Session: 2026-01-27 (Feature #53 - Move Follow Button to Header)

### Feature #53 Completed: Move Follow on Instagram Button to Header

**Status:** ✅ PASSING

**Category:** UI

**Description:** The 'Follow on Instagram' button was at the bottom of grid/slider layouts, requiring users to scroll. Moved it to the top header area so it's immediately visible without scrolling.

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Modified templates/frontend/feed.php:**
   - Combined account header logic with Follow button display
   - Created new `.bwg-igf-feed-header` container (lines 602-662)
   - Header shows when either account name OR Follow button is enabled
   - Moved Follow button from bottom (removed lines 879-890) to header
   - Button placed on right side using flexbox space-between

2. **Modified assets/css/frontend.css:**
   - Renamed `.bwg-igf-account-header` to `.bwg-igf-feed-header`
   - Added `justify-content: space-between` for proper alignment
   - Added `flex: 1` to `.bwg-igf-account-info` for proper spacing
   - Added responsive CSS for mobile (lines 1221-1229):
     - Header stacks vertically on mobile (flex-direction: column)
     - Follow button stretches full width on mobile
     - Button centered using justify-content: center

**Verification Steps:**

1. ✅ **Desktop Grid Layout** (1280x720):
   - Follow button appears in header, right-aligned
   - No scrolling needed to see button
   - Grid posts display below header

2. ✅ **Desktop Slider Layout**:
   - Follow button appears in header above slider
   - Slider navigation and dots work correctly
   - Button visible without scrolling

3. ✅ **Mobile Layout** (375x667):
   - Header stacks vertically
   - Follow button full width below stale indicator
   - Button remains accessible at top

4. ✅ **No duplicate button at bottom**:
   - Scrolled to bottom of feed
   - Confirmed button only appears in header
   - Feed ends with Instagram posts

5. ✅ **No console errors detected**

**User Experience Improvements:**
- Button immediately visible on page load
- No need to scroll to find Follow button
- Works consistently across Grid and Slider layouts
- Mobile-friendly responsive design
- Clean, professional header layout

**Technical Notes:**

- Uses existing Instagram gradient button styles
- Maintains backward compatibility with account name feature
- Flexbox layout ensures proper spacing on all screen sizes

**No console errors detected.**
